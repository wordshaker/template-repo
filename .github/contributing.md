## Team Workflow
_Edit to accurately represent the teams way of working_

This repository is currently the responsibility of `team name`. If you want to raise work that needs to be done, please raise it with the product manager of the team, or the tech lead. 

The work will then go onto our backlog and be subject to our usual practices for prioritisation within the team.

The team confluence page can be viewed [here]().

## Pull Requests

_Edit to accurately represent the teams PR practices_

### Making a change
- Create branch. Give it a descriptive name relating to what the work covers. See some examples below.
    - `instrument-request-rate`
    - `refactor-integration-tests`

- Open a Pull Request with the details listed in the [pull request template](../pull_request_template.md). The sections of this template should show in the body of any new pull request automatically.

### Approval Process
- The PR will need a minimum of _X_ approvals before being merged
- Please address any comments either with changes or with a reply on why you won't be making adjustments.
- Once you have the required number of approvals, you as the contributor can squash and merge the PR.

### Reviewing a PR
- Pull down the branch and run the tests locally. 
- Be respectful and professional in commments.
- Where possible, add links to references to share learning in comments.
